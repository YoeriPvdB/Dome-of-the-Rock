            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>The Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Jewish Second Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE. Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian.

                Jerusalem was ruled by the Byzantine Empire throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to develop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built under Constantine in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under Julian the Apostate.

        <h3>Persian, Hasmonean and Herodian periods</h3>
        <p>
            The hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE.
            Assuming colocation with the biblical Mount Zion, its southern section would have been walled at the beginning of the second millennium BCE, in around 1850 BCE, by Canaanites who established a settlement there (or in the vicinity) named Jebus.
            Jewish tradition identifies it with Mount Moriah where the binding of Isaac took place. According to the Hebrew Bible, the Temple Mount was originally a threshing-floor owned by Araunah, a Jebusite. The prophet Gad suggested the area to King David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to Yawheh, since a destroying angel was standing there when God stopped a great plague in Jerusalem.

            David then bought the property from Araunah, for fifty pieces of silver, and erected the altar. YHWH instructed David to build a sanctuary on the site, outside the city walls on the northern edge of the hill. The building was to replace the Tabernacle, and serve as the Temple of the Israelites in Jerusalem.
            The Temple Mount is an important part of Biblical archaeology.

        </p>

        <p>It is considered the third most holy site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina, for being the site of both Muhammad leading the other prophets in prayer and ascending to heaven to speak with seven prophets. It was also the location for Muslim worshippers to face during prayer, until being changed to Mecca.
            While the site has been identified as the location for the above events since the 8th century, before this it was mainly an oral tradition. So although it was seen as an important site at the time anyway, it is not possible to be certain for this exact reasoning behind constructing the Dome above the Rock.

            <!-- <h1>BYZANTINE ERA HISTORY</h1> -->
            <h3>Late Roman period</h3>
            <p>
                From the 1st through the 7th centuries Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, gradually became the predominant religion of Palestine and under the Byzantines Jerusalem itself was almost completely Christian, with most of the population being Jacobite Christians of the Syrian rite.

                Emperor Constantine I promoted the Christianization of Roman society, giving it precedence over pagan cults. One consequence was that Hadrian's Temple to Jupiter on the Temple Mount was demolished immediately following the First Council of Nicea in 325 CE on orders of Constantine.

    <div class="content-fullparagraph">

        <p> The Bordeaux Pilgrim, who visited Jerusalem in 333–334, during the reign of Emperor Constantine I, wrote that "There are two statues of Hadrian, and, not far from them, a pierced stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint. They mourn and rend their garments, and then depart."
            The occasion is assumed to have been Tisha b'Av, since decades later Jerome related that that was the only day on which Jews were permitted to enter Jerusalem.

            Constantine's nephew Emperor Julian granted permission in the year 363 for the Jews to rebuild the Temple. In a letter attributed to Julian he wrote to the Jews that "This you ought to do, in order that, when I have successfully concluded the war in Persia, I may rebuild by my own efforts the sacred city of Jerusalem, which for so many years you have longed to see inhabited, and may bring settlers there, and, together with you, may glorify the Most High God therein."
            Julian saw the Jewish God as a fitting member of the pantheon of gods he believed in, and he was also a strong opponent of Christianity. Church historians wrote that the Jews began to clear away the structures and rubble on the Temple Mount but were thwarted, first by a great earthquake, and then by miracles that included fire springing from the earth.
            However, no contemporary Jewish sources mention this episode directly</p>
